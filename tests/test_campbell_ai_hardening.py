"""Regression guards for the Campbell AI latency and concurrency work.

Deliberately small. One test per mechanism that was actually broken in production,
chosen so that a regression in any of them fails here rather than in front of a user.
Everything else about Campbell AI is covered by the older suites alongside this file.

The five failures these pin, in the order they were found:

1. Synchronous tool bodies ran inline on the event loop, so one user's pandas work
   froze the worker for everyone.
2. An agent run had no wall-clock bound, and retries could triple it.
3. Replayed history was bounded by message count, not size, so long conversations got
   slower every turn until they timed out.
4. The answer belonged to the HTTP request, so a caller that went away orphaned the run
   and its result was only discovered on the next page load.
5. The session lock was held across the whole agent run, so a second question in one
   conversation waited 20s and was then rejected however idle the service was.

Timings are coarse — tens of milliseconds against budgets several times larger — so the
suite stays honest on a loaded machine.
