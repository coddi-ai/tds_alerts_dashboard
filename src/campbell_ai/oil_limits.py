"""Four-limit oil thresholds and element grouping, for Campbell AI's oil visuals.

The dashboard already owns this logic in ``dashboard/components/oil_charts.py`` and
``dashboard/callbacks/alerts_callbacks.py``. This module deliberately re-states the parts
Campbell AI needs instead of importing them, for a concrete deployment reason: the API
container mounts ``./src``, ``./config`` and ``./data``, but **not** ``./dashboard`` - that
package only reaches the image through the Dockerfile's ``COPY``. An import across that
boundary would work on a fresh build and then silently serve stale code the moment someone
edits the dashboard without rebuilding, because ``src`` is live-mounted and ``dashboard`` is
not. ``src`` has never imported from ``dashboard``; this keeps it that way.

The consequence is that the two copies can drift, so the pieces reproduced here are the ones
that are stable and few: the classification boundaries, the ring radii and the group split.
Anything richer stays in the dashboard.

Three ideas carry the whole module:

- **The four-limit contract (v2.8).** LIC/LIM/LSM/LSC bound five states: Normal, Inferior and
  Superior Marginal, Inferior and Superior Condenatorio. ``LIC``/``LIM`` are ``None`` for
  whole element groups (wear metals, additives) and a missing lower limit is never a lower
  limit of zero.
- **Normalization to fixed radii.** Every threshold lands on the same radius across axes, so
  the rings are circles. Scaling by a single threshold cannot do this: measured on CDA the
  ratio LSC/LSM spans 1.0 to 8.5, which would draw the outer ring as a jagged shape.
- **Element groups.** Wear metals, contaminants and additives answer different questions and
  are read separately in any oil report, so they get one radar each rather than sharing axes.
