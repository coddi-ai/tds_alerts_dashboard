"""One structured snapshot of the Campbell AI API process, for operators without a console.

Everything needed to answer "why is it slow now when it was fast this morning" in a
single payload: resident memory against the container's own limit, what each cache is
holding, the thread census, how many reclaims have fired and what the last one freed,
where the logs are and how large. These are only meaningful *together* - high memory with
a full cache is a tuning problem, high memory with empty caches and a climbing thread
count is a leak somewhere else, and the same number appears in both stories.

``tail_log`` exists because a diagnostics payload nobody can act on is a poster. Reading
the last few hundred lines over HTTP is what makes this something you can debug with.

No secrets, credentials, usernames or conversation content appear in any payload here.
The endpoints that serve it are still authenticated - it is operational detail and does
not belong on the open internet - but a leaked snapshot exposes sizes and counts.
