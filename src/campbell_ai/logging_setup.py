"""Rotating log file for the Campbell AI API process, scoped to this package.

The service had no log file of its own: everything went to stdout and lived only as
long as the container's log driver kept it. That makes an incident unreadable after the
fact, which is the whole problem when the symptom is "it was fine this morning".

Two scoping decisions matter, because this package lives inside a larger repository it
does not own:

**The root logger is never touched.** Handlers are attached to the ``campbell_ai``
logger and to uvicorn's, and nothing else. Reconfiguring root from library code would
hijack the logging of whatever process happened to import this module - the dashboard
imports parts of this package, and it has its own logging policy. Attaching to a named
subtree cannot do that.

**``campbell_ai`` stops propagating.** Once this package owns handlers for its own
subtree, letting records continue to root would duplicate every line into whatever the
host process configured. Isolation here is what makes "the API's logs" a well-defined
set of lines in a well-defined file.

Console output is left to uvicorn for its own loggers, so request lines are not printed
twice; this module only adds the console handler ``campbell_ai`` would otherwise lack.

Disk use is bounded and calculable: ``CAMPBELL_AI_LOG_MAX_BYTES x
(CAMPBELL_AI_LOG_BACKUP_COUNT + 1)``, 60 MB with the defaults. History beyond that is
not lost - ``log_archive.py`` ships sealed files to S3 before they are recycled.

    - **A separate file.** Two processes cannot share a ``RotatingFileHandler``: neither
      can rotate the other's handle, and interleaved writes across a rollover corrupt the
      file. ``campbell_ui.log`` is the frontend's; ``campbell_api.log`` is the service's.
    - **Propagation stays on.** Unlike the API subtree, records here keep flowing to the
      host's root logger, so ``dashboard.log`` still receives exactly what it received
      before. Silencing lines the dashboard's maintainers may rely on is not ours to
      decide; adding a second, rotated copy costs them nothing.
